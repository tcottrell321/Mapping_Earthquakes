# Mapping_Earthquakes

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last
seven days.

# Resources
* JavaScript
* D3 and Leaflet library 
* USGS website to retrieve earthquake data for last 7 days in the GeoJSON files format. 
* Mapbox API token
* Teachtonic Plate data 

# Earthquake Challenge
For the challenge, we modified the LogicStep6 file to create:
- a 3rd map tile
- a 2nd techtonic plate overlay

The 2 overlays - 1) earthquake data and 2) techtonic plate data can be toggled on or off by the use on any of the 3 map views.
