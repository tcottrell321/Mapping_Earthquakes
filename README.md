# Mapping_Earthquakes

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last
seven days.As a good practice "THE CONFIG FILE" was NOT uploaded to the repository. The config file contains the API Key and is required to run the program. 

# Resources
* JavaScript
* D3 and Leaflet library 
* USGS website to retrieve earthquake data for last 7 days in the GeoJSON files format. 
* Mapbox API token
* External data techtonic plates

# Approach
We built multiple versions of various maps, learning to use the MapBox attributes. We created branches for each section allowing us to test the code with the idea that once code was fully debugged and approved, we could then merge back in with the master. 

# Earthquake Challenge
* We created a base with 3 different maps
* We then added 2 overlays:
1) Earthquake overlay
2) Techtonic overlay

The overlays have a toggle control.
